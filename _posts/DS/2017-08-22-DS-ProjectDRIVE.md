### Why do this Project?
Progess1 : `Elucidation of the mutational landscape of human cancer`  
Progess2 : `the development of therapeutics targeting mutant oncogenes.`

**However.....**  

Unprogress1 : `comprehensive mapping of
cancer dependencies`  
Unprogress2 : `discovery
of therapeutic targets for counteracting(抵消) tumor
suppressor gene loss`  

**So...**  

Novartis launch the Project Drive `To identify vulnerabilities(缺陷) relevant to specific cancer subtypes.`

### What does the project do?  
Conducted a large-scale RNAi screen,evaluate the effect(Viability effects of mRNA knockdown) in 398 cell line*7837 gene.  

### What's the result?  
Outlines:  
1. The classes of cancer dependency genes
2. And their relationships to genetic, expression, and lineage features.
3. Describe robust gene-interaction
networks recapitulating(重述) both protein complexes
and functional cooperation among complexes and
pathways.  
4. Drive dataset along with a web portal is provided to the community to assist in the discovery and translation of new therapeutic approaches for cancer.  

### ATARIS and RSA  
RSA : RSA uses `all shRNA reagents` against a given gene to calculate a statistical significance that knockdown of gene X leads to loss of viability. RSA was used to determine whether a gene was essential, active, or inert.

ATARiS : ATARiS gene level scores incorporate `only shRNAs that have consistent activity across the entire
dataset` and attempts to eliminate inert(惰性) or potential off-target shRNAs.The ATARiS algorithm median centers shRNA level scores across all screened cell lines, resulting in a metric of relative effects so essential and inert gene profiles appear no different.all
other analyses used ATARiS to focus on only shRNA reagents
with consistent, on-target activity.
