## Low Data Drug Discovery with One-shot Learning

### 1. Descriptions
* Introduce one-shot learning method used to lower the amounts of data required
to make meaningful predictions in drug discovery applications.
* Open source all the works in this paper as
part of DeepChem

### 2. Background
* The lead optimization step of drug discovery is fundamentally a low-data problem,Because:
  * A particular molecule can modulate essential pathways to achieve therapeutic activity
  * But discovered molecule often fails as a potential drug for  including toxicity, low activity, and low solubility
  * So,central problem of drug-dis is to optimize the candidate molecule by finding analogue molecules with better activity and less risks
  * And,only a small amount of biological data available on the candidate and related molecules
* The small amount of data could not get an accurate predictions for novel compounds  

### 3. Methods
* ont-shot learning
* residule LSTM
* graph-CNN

### 4. Data
* [Tox21](https://tripod.nih.gov/tox21/challenge/)  
  * Aim : To develop better toxicity assessment methods to quickly and efficiently test whether certain chemical compounds have the potential to disrupt processes in the human body that may lead to negative health effects.
  * Means : Using the Center’s high-throughput robotic screening system to test 10,000 environmental chemicals and approved drugs for their potential to disrupt biological pathways that may result in toxicity.
  * Tox21 Challenge : Use data generated from nuclear receptor signaling and stress pathway assays run against Tox21's 10,000-compound library to build models and look for structure-activity relationships.

* SIDER dataset
* MUV dataset
