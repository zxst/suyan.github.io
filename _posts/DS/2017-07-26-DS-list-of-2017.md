## Low Data Drug Discovery with One-shot Learning

### 1. Descriptions
* Introduce one-shot learning method used to lower the amounts of data required
to make meaningful predictions in drug discovery applications.
* Open source all the works in this paper as
part of DeepChem

### 2. Background
* The lead optimization step of drug discovery is fundamentally a low-data problem,Because:
  * A particular molecule can modulate essential pathways to achieve therapeutic activity
  * But discovered molecule often fails as a potential drug for  including toxicity, low activity, and low solubility
  * So,central problem of drug-dis is to optimize the candidate molecule by finding analogue molecules with better activity and less risks
  * And,only a small amount of biological data available on the candidate and related molecules
* The small amount of data could not get an accurate predictions for novel compounds  

### 3. Methods
* ont-shot learning
* residule LSTM
* graph-CNN

### 4. Data

### 5. Conclusion

### 6. Notes
