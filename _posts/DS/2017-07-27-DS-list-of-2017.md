## Tox21,SIDER and MUV
### Tox21
The full name of Tox21 is "The Toxicology in
the 21st Century".
#### Aims
 It aims to develop better toxicity assessment
 methods to quickly and efficiently test whether
 certain chemical compounds have the potential
 to disrupt processes in the human body that
 may lead to negative health effects.

 #### Means
 Using the Center’s `high-throughput robotic
 screening system` to test 10,000 environmental
  chemicals and approved drugs for their
  potential to disrupt biological pathways
  that may result in toxicity.
#### Tox21 Challenge
Use data generated from nuclear receptor
signaling and stress pathway assays run against
 Tox21's 10,000-compound library to build
  models and look for structure-activity
  relationships.

  #### Data
  I have already downloaded the data of all Challenges
  and import it to R.
  * Datasize : 124M in R,and contains 11751 elements.
  * Datatype : .SDF document type,import using ChemmineR
  package.

#### Data analysis pipeline
We introduce the [DeepTox](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fenvs.2015.00080/full) which has the highest performance of all computational methods winning the grand challenge.
##### 1. Normalizes the chemical representations of the compounds
##### 2. Computes a large number of chemical descriptors as model inputs
##### 3. Trains models, evaluates them, and combines the best of them to ensembles.
The pipeline in detail as follows:
